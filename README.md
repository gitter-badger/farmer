## Getting Started
Farmer comes with a installer script with will bring a complete Farmer up in a few minutes.  
You only need an **Ubuntu 14.04** and **git** client installed on your server.

### Quick Installation
As simple as running commands below:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/farmer-project/farmer.git
sudo hack/install
```

### How does it work?
Farmer works very simple for almost any small project.

1. You put a [`.farmer.yml`](docs/farmer.yml.md) in root of your git-hosted project. (Read more about [`.farmer.yml`](docs/farmer.yml.md))
2. You use [`farmer-cli`](https://github.com/farmer-project/farmer-cli) to [create a single instance](https://github.com/farmer-project/farmer-cli#create-a-box) of your project with a unique name.
3. You [assign a domain](https://github.com/farmer-project/farmer-cli#assign-a-domain-to-a-box) to you box using farmer-cli.
4. Your web app is up and running.

You can repeat this process for as many projects and as many boxes as you like. That's why it can be used as a small PaaS for your SaaS :)

### Farmer Client
To access and manage your Farmer server you need to run our command-line program.  
Visit [**farmer-cli**](https://github.com/farmer-project/farmer-cli) for installation intructions.
